<body> For starters when I begin reviewing this site, I want to see how user friendly the site will be to the people to need to use it the most. The students and their parents, the parents because they are usually the ones paying the bill, and the students because they  will have to do the work to stay in school. 
With those things fresh in mind every website is made up of several components in order to work, look, and run successfully. Through my examination of the website and, exploration of the site I found, UNCG’s website to be a clean, vibrant and accessible.

THE BLUE AND GOLD
The color was strong the royal blue and gold showed they owed their colors! They were proud of their blue and gold. It’s a school website so it’s more like to be this way, but anywhere else I guess they would have to take pride in the colors they choose for their website.  It can make a difference on your students and how they react to your website and your organizations. 
ARE READING WHAT I’m READING
UNCG fonts where crisp and clean and most important easy to read. What sense does it make to load down you website with a bunch of great information but the text is too small. Sure some people can go to the setting and increase the viewing size by the percentage. But again another unnecessary step. 
PICTURE THIS
UNCG did not overload their website with pictures or unnecessary graphics. They had their social media graphics emphasizes in one corner on the page, so it was easy to see and locate as well as link to the social media site. One thing that I like a lot was on the homepage, it was a picture collage. The picture showed a diverse collection of student throughout campus. As a parent or student looking to attend a new school that would be something I would be looking for in today’s schools.
