<body>This site definitely appeals to the averae patron because the layout is so simple but highly effective. It is a clean site with a vibrate look, and anyone without any technical background would skill be able to navigate and appreciate it. The layout makes anyone feel comfortable because it is so well organize and you can easily locate what you are looking for. The design is very professional and well done. I love how the SPL logo image on left hand side, drop down to a smaller version so that you are able to scroll up and down the pages without it obstructing your view of page. They also did a nice job at using a variety of colors on the home. The two color scheme is good and when they added in the pops of hot pink and hints of blacks made the page standout more. 
The site feels welcoming. The fonts are different and the vary in size so you eyes don't get tired of the same boring font from page to page. There nice subtitles to guide you around the site, and what's going on in the commnunty.
